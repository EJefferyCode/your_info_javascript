# your_info_javascript

<h2>Hello All!</h2>
<p>This is, in fact, a very basic program that allows/prompts a user to enter their information, and recieve their information
back in a neat, concatenated sentence structure. This will be improved upon within the coming days, as I see a lot of potential
with this kind of program, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Can be used to give a user back information based on their answers, such as a quiz, or questionnaire.</li>
  <li>A cool and interesting idea I had, was to use this format, but instead of having a "prompt", the user would enter their
  information in a form, which will then alert them of their answers, such as "What does your name say about your?", where given
  their name length, or depending upon how many letters are in their name, they would be give a concatenated answer, one of
  several possible answers.</li>
</ul>

Thanks for checking this out. Feel free to leave any feedback, or add anything you feel would be of benefit. :D
